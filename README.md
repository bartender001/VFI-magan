LEFT: Normal Unet-GAN; Right: Our Novel GAN Hybrid.  
Blue Box: better color grading. Red Box: better edges. Results shown via ablation (removing our novel part reduces the model to a vanilla GAN).
/n
SSIM improvement of 7% from vanilla GAN, at 20 epochs, 900 training triplets and 100 testing triplets.
